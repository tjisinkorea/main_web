								<p> I had taken and completed 3 courses on codecademy using their 7 day trial in early June. However, their certificate expired because I never paid I guess.
									So I paid for a month of the Pro Version to relink those certificates and finish some courses that I never completed.</p>

								<p>Today I'm going to take a look at the course titled "Learn The Basics Of Blockchain With Python". I have a basic understanding of Python from 
									the course I had started a few months back on Udemy, but I'd say I'm only about 50% fluent. I also have an interest in cryptocurrency and how 
									the blockchain works so this seems like a fun course. Blockchain could potentially be a powerful tool in the future and knowing is half the battle.
									I am a fan of ADA Cardano, and they deployed in Africa as an identification system for their students. 
								</p>
								<p>I've gained some linux and BASH knowledge from the Google IT Support Specialist course and tidbits from here and there. But I'll work on Linux course
									here as well. I do like codecademy because it is a more hands-on approach than just reading a manual or watching a tutorial video.
								</p>
								<p>I'll also work on this website a little more:</p>
									<ul> add archives to this blog section
										<li>add archives to this blog section</li>
										<li>add more about my experience at Zoom Digital</li>
										<li>maybe add a page with videos of my presentations/tutorials. Probably a link to a youtube playlist. maybe include
											the certs I've obtained
										</li>
										<li>maybe add a music page? link to my soundcloud, some photos? maybe not.</li>
									</ul>	
								<p>That's probably a butt-load for today.</p>

							<h2 class="major">What I'm learning.</h2>
								<p>July 17th, 2021</p>
								<p>I've been self-studying a lot of different topics in the last few months, mostly in the broad field of IT. It includes network systems, network security,
									cloud networks, linux os, python, web development, ethical hacking and more. I've been considering diving deeper into a specific field and getting
									a certification, but I haven't decided which path to go. Three options are:	</p>
									<ul>
										<li>CCNA</li>
										<li>Comptia Network Security+</li>
										<li>AWS Solutions Architect Associate</li>
									</ul>
								<p>One of these certs is what will consume most of my time. However I am always looking up random things. I just recently learned of Netlify, and how I 
									can host websites for free by linking with github. Like this website, and my landing page! They are two separate git repositories. I got a free .tk 
									domain and forwarded it to the landing page. So these two websites are 100% free as I have both the hosting and DNS taken care of.	</p>
								<p>Surprisingly, ordering from Amazon US only charges $8.75 for shipping to Korea. I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered a Raspberry Pi 4, 8GB with the Canakit
									which provides me with everything I need. It also takes less than 1 week to ship. I think it will arrive in the next few days so I will be tinkering with that!
									I have a bunch of micro SD cards ready to try different projects. </p>
								<p>I'm thinking of making this section into a blogging style area. I'll "archive" each post into a link here at first... or maybe title them. 
									I dunno! This site is a work in progress!</p>
