								<p>My name is TJ and I am an American expat currently residing in Korea. .</p>
								<p>What to write here... mmmmmmmm... the possibilities...</p>
								<p> While you're here, please do take a look at my <a href="#about">CV</a> and let me know if you are interested in learning more about me,
									and how I could be a fit for your company. I work great with teams and can take leadership roles, but I am also a go-getter type that works perfectly fine alone as well.

								<h2 class="major">What I'm learning now.</h2>
								<!-- <span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
								<p>July 18th, 2021</p>
								<p>There is so much knowledge to be gained, so many questions to be asked, so many mysteries to be solved. It is one of the beauties of life - 
									we can learn and learn but there is always more to discover. 
								</p>
								<p>I've been self-studying a lot of different topics in the last few months, mostly in the broad field of IT. It includes network systems, network security,
									cloud networks, linux os, python, web development, ethical hacking and more. I've been considering diving deeper into a specific field and getting
									a certification, but I haven't decided which path to go. Three options are:
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>CCNA</li>
									<li>Comptia Network Security+</li>
									<li>AWS Solutions Architect Associate</li>
								</ul>
								<p>One of these certs is what will consume most of my time. However I am always looking up random things. I just recently learned of Netlify, and how I 
									can host websites for free by linking with github. Like this website, and my landing page! They are two separate git repositories. I got a free .tk 
									domain and forwarded it to the landing page. So these two websites are 100% free as I have both the hosting and DNS taken care of.
								</p>
								<p>Surprisingly, ordering from Amazon US only charges $8.75 for shipping to Korea. I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered a Raspberry Pi 4, 8GB with the Canakit
									which provides me with everything I need. It also takes less than 1 week to ship. I think it will arrive in the next few days so I will be tinkering with that!
									I have a bunch of micro SD cards ready to try different projects. 
								</p>
								<p>I'm thinking of making this section into a blogging style area. I'll "archive" each post into a link here at first... or maybe title them. 
									I dunno! This site is a workin progress!
