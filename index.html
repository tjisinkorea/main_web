								<p>My name is TJ and I am an American expat currently residing in Korea.</p>
								<p align="center"><img src="/images/r2_toronto.jpg" height="500"></p>

								<p>My previous working experience had me dive into the Audio Video industry, and the different clients had me explore even further into various sectors.
									I've gotten to work with small businesses, larger corporations, restaurants, hospitals, IT departments, pharmacies, real estate, sporting stadiums,
									universities, government agencies, scientists and more. I've also had the pleasure of traveling the country with NASA's educational outreach
									team to provide technical support with their Hyperwall Lecture Series. I was even fortunate enough to witness a rocket launch!

								</iframe></p>
								
								<p>I've gained a lot of experience in company operations, marketing, sales, logistics, event planning, product planning/launch/management, channel rep and integrator
									relations, and so much more. Now that I'm in a new country, I'm ready to step up to bat again to see what I can offer to a different company.

								<p> While you're here, please do take a look at my <a href="https://tjkyong.netlify.app/tjkyong_cv_aws_090121.pdf" target="blank">CV</a> and let me know if you are interested in learning more about me,
									and how I could be a fit for your company. I work great with teams and can take leadership roles, but I am also a go-getter type that works 
									perfectly fine alone as well.

							<h2 class="major">Work experience</h2>
							<p>I spent the last four years working for Z. It was a small company that offered Audio Visual solutions at the commercial level.
								The CEO had downsized the company a few years back to focus on another project, and hiring me was an attempt to revitalize Z. When
								I joined as the Director of Sales, they had a few loyal accounts, but it was struggling.	</p>
							<p>In my first month, I landed an account with a company that built booths for tradeshows. We were to offer a turnkey solution of renting out our
								video wall displays and providing installation as well as tech support. This really opened up the door to a new rental market, and this account led to 
							    many other accounts in the same booth building sector.</p>
							<p>I remember my second account very clearly, as it was a subsidiary of JP Morgan in the real estate market. They wanted an interactive WayFinding kiosk
								in each of their 6 lobbies that provided map guidance to users, as well as provide other information they wanted to convey. We provided six 40" 
								touchscreen displays connected to Intel NUCs. I created an Amazon EC2 instance of a Windows server so that all 6 computers can be updated remotely. 
								The hard part was creating the Wayfinding software. The next two months I spent with our engineer and designer to create maps of the buildings
								and creating routes, creating database of tenants, and so much more. But it was a huge sale, and even to this day an important account as they still
								pay monthly for server usage and support.	</p>
							
							<p>Up to this point our strategy was direct sales to businesses and consumers, but I decided to try to work our strategy into channel sales. I contracted
								manufacturer's reps from different territories and was able to snag with them their reseller/integrator contacts as well. This was a huge change 
								because now integrators called us with project leads.
							</p>
							<p>I had pretty much become the spokesman of the company, dealing with all external requests, making contracts with distributors/integrators/reps,
								reaching out to vendors and managing key government accounts. I was also responsible for creating bids for government RFQs. 
							</p>
							<p>By the time I left Z, I was personally averaging $250,000 per quarter in sales, not too shabby for starting out by cold-calling with zero leads. 
								I'm sure if COVID hadn't struck, and I hadn't left sales would have kept climbing YoY, especially because our "channel" network was becoming
								well established and I had just completed Z's GSA contract which listed us onto the US government procurement databases as a trusted manufacturer.
							<p>Because of these experiences at Z, my knowledge in company operations is very rounded. I believe that this gives me an edge and also the confidence
								to be able to take on a variety of roles, whatever they may be, at my next opportunity. I accept and await my newest challenge!
							</p>

							<h2 class="major">Demos</h2>
							<p> I have organized exhibitions at dozens of tradeshows including CES, Infocomm, DSE and more. While exhibiting,
								I liked to take the opportunity to film a video showcasing our newest products. The videos are short, and always
								filmed in one take, so please excuse any brain-farts I may have had!

								<p>August 19, 2021</p>
								<p>Been doing this and that, but mostly spending time taking a AWS SAA-C02 test prep course on Udemy. I was hoping to finish in 2 week, but I was
									a few days behind schedule, as I finished yesterday. I understand all concepts at a high level, so just scratching the surface mostly, but 
									have done hands-on with several accounts on AWS (free tier stuff only). I took the free 10 question quiz available on AWS and got 70%. I definitely
									need to go over the course again from the beginning maybe at 1.5x speed. But before that, I want to actually take a second course on
									acloudguru, which seems to be the go to reference for AWS cert study. It's $40 a month, but there is a 7 day trial, so maybe I can do it in the 
									7 days allotted. I'm not trying to be cheap, but these time contraints are good for motivation! For example, when I did the same with CodecademyPro
									I finished the HTML, CSS, and BOOTSTRAP courses within that time, albeit I already knew most of the basics. I paid for a month subscription 
									afterwards to get the "certificates" (which don't really have value) which you need to be a pro member. However, because of no real time constraint,
									I wasn't motivated enough to finish any other courses. But to be fair, I spent the majority of my time on Udemy. 
								</p>
								<p>When I was 16, I was an intern at a non-profit for student activism and I built their website. I wanted to see if it still existed, but it led to 
									404 Error page. But it was a pretty sick 404 page, I guess someone parked the domain and forwarded to a sweet hacker theme page. I did some
									copypasta modifications and made it my new landing page. It's pretty dope, and looks more appropriate to my taste than the moving mountains.
									<A href="http://tjkyong.me">http://tjkyong.me - my landing page</A>
								</p>
								<p>I'm aiming to sign up for the SAA-C02 test on September 1, which gives me about 2 weeks. I think it's enough time... but like I said, I need this 
									time pressure to be productive. Honestly, I don't know if I can get a job as a solutions architect associate with just the cert, but let's take it step
									by step, and do some more hands on.

									<h2 class="major">What I'm learning.</h2>
								<p>August 1, 2021</p>
								<p>I did something fun over the weekend. I ordered a RaspberryPi4 8GB RAM from Amazon... That's right, to Korea. It shipped in about 
									10 days, and there was no import fees, and only $8 for shipping. It was a better deal than buying one locally.
								</p>
								<p>I messed around with some different builds. I tried the RETROPI emulator to play oldschool games. Neat, but I don't want to invest any time playing
									those oldskool video games. I tried a few different flavors of Linux operating systems. I tried a build where I installed VMWare esxi hyperviser
									so I can run multiple virtual machines simultaneously from my single Pi4. I thought this was going to be my permanent build, and it probably will,
									but I got a little impatient with Linux Servers taking so long to set up via USB storage. 
								</p>
								<p>So I decided to setup Raspbian OS and install Pi-Hole. Pi-Hole allows me to set up a custom local DNS that blocks ALL advertisements.
									I SSH into my pi4 to access it's command line. Then here are the steps:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Install Pi-Hole - sudo curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash</li>
										<li>Install Unbound DNS - sudo apt install unbound</li>
										<li>Create Unbound Configuration File - sudo nano /etc/unbound/unbound.conf.d/pi-hole.conf</li>
										<li>Copy example config - https://docs.pi-hole.net/guides/dns/unbound/</li>
										<li>Restart Unbound to apply Configuration - sudo service unbound restart</li>
										<li>Disable Forwarding DNS in PiHole</li>
										<li>Set Custom DNS in PiHole - 127.0.0.1#5335</li>	
										<li>Set custom DNS to my pi4 in any device that I want to block ads</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p>Not only does it block ads, I get a log of all the queries. Also, I can manually set whitelists and blacklists of domains. If I wanted to block 
									certain sites like netflix or youtube to prevent people on my network from joining, I could. But If I wanted to authorize this totalitarian 
									internet regime, I would have to change the DNS on my router, not on individual devices.
								</p>
								<p>It's pretty neat. No more ads on web browsers or Apps.</p>

									<h2 class="major">What I'm learning.</h2>
								<p>July 27, 2021</p>
								<p>I've steered my ship towards AWS. Upon investigating the AWS certs, I felt that I could skip the lowest level Cloud Practition certificate
									and go straight for Solutions Architect - Associate (SAA-C02). I already have experience with EC2 and running Windows Instances to run 
									software that acts as a server for digital signage software, so so far it has been smooth sailing with the fundamentals but I'm sure 
								the material will get more dense as I progress. What I have covered in the last few days: </p>
								<ul>
									<li>AWS Infrastructure, fundamentals</li>
									<li>IAM management</li>
									<li>EFS</li>
									<li>EC2 instances, elastic IPs, load balancers, placement groups, security groups, snapshots</li>
								</ul>
								<p>I'm learning from a course taught by Stephane Maarek, which was highly recommended from various communities on the internet. The course is useful 
									that there are hands-on sections where I can execute what I am learning on my AWS account. My goal is to complete the course in 2 weeks, and 
									suppliment with other sources and practice exams. This would allow me to take the exam online late Aug. That is my goal. 
								</p>
								<br>
								<p>Although I have the goal, it does get stale just doing one thing! I have completed the Blockchain Python course on codecademy. It was 
									insightful on how a blockchain can be created with Python, but also discouraging that my knowledge in Python is still very weak. I was 
								able to complete the course but I really fumbled through it. However, it is to be expected since I have not completed any Python courses, 
								just tidbits here and there. </p>
								<p>Everywhere I turn to on my learning journey, I hear things of SQL for data science. I was never enticed with the language, however, I am
									getting an urge to look into it so that I can create my own personal database. Primarly, I'm interested in a password manager database... 
									I know I can just subscribe to a service, but it would be cool to build one myself. 
								</p>

									<h2 class="major">What I'm learning.</h2>
								<p>July 18, 2021</p>
								<p> I had taken and completed 3 courses on codecademy using their 7 day trial in early June. However, their certificate expired because I never paid I guess.
									So I paid for a month of the Pro Version to relink those certificates and finish some courses that I never completed.</p>

								<p>Today I'm going to take a look at the course titled "Learn The Basics Of Blockchain With Python". I have a basic understanding of Python from 
									the course I had started a few months back on Udemy, but I'd say I'm only about 50% fluent. I also have an interest in cryptocurrency and how 
									the blockchain works so this seems like a fun course. Blockchain could potentially be a powerful tool in the future and knowing is half the battle.
									I am a fan of ADA Cardano, and they deployed in Africa as an identification system for their students. 
								</p>
								<p>I've gained some linux and BASH knowledge from the Google IT Support Specialist course and tidbits from here and there. But I'll work on Linux course
									here as well. I do like codecademy because it is a more hands-on approach than just reading a manual or watching a tutorial video.
								</p>
								<p>I'll also work on this website a little more:</p>
									<ul> 
										<li>add archives to this blog section</li>
										<li>add archives to this blog section</li>
										<li>add more about my experience at Zoom Digital</li>
										<li>maybe add a page with videos of my presentations/tutorials. Probably a link to a youtube playlist. maybe include
											the certs I've obtained
										</li>
										<li>maybe add a music page? link to my soundcloud, some photos? maybe not.</li>
									</ul>	
								<p>That's probably a butt-load for today.</p>

							<h2 class="major">What I'm learning.</h2>
								<p>July 17th, 2021</p>
								<p>I've been self-studying a lot of different topics in the last few months, mostly in the broad field of IT. It includes network systems, network security,
									cloud networks, linux os, python, web development, ethical hacking and more. I've been considering diving deeper into a specific field and getting
									a certification, but I haven't decided which path to go. Three options are:	</p>
									<ul>
										<li>CCNA</li>
										<li>Comptia Network Security+</li>
										<li>AWS Solutions Architect Associate</li>
									</ul>
								<p>One of these certs is what will consume most of my time. However I am always looking up random things. I just recently learned of Netlify, and how I 
									can host websites for free by linking with github. Like this website, and my landing page! They are two separate git repositories. I got a free .tk 
									domain and forwarded it to the landing page. So these two websites are 100% free as I have both the hosting and DNS taken care of.	</p>
								<p>Surprisingly, ordering from Amazon US only charges $8.75 for shipping to Korea. I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered a Raspberry Pi 4, 8GB with the Canakit
									which provides me with everything I need. It also takes less than 1 week to ship. I think it will arrive in the next few days so I will be tinkering with that!
									I have a bunch of micro SD cards ready to try different projects. </p>
								<p>I'm thinking of making this section into a blogging style area. I'll "archive" each post into a link here at first... or maybe title them. 
									I dunno! This site is a work in progress!</p>
