								<p>My name is TJ and I am an American expat currently residing in Korea.</p>
								<p align="center"><img src="/images/r2_toronto.jpg" height="500"></p>

								<p>My previous working experience had me dive into the Audio Video industry, and the different clients had me explore even further in various sectors.
									I've gotten to work with small businesses, larger corporations, restaurants, hospitals, IT departments, pharmacies, real estate, sporting stadiums,
									universities, government agencies, scientists and more. I also had the pleasure of traveling the country with NASA's educational outreach
									team to provide technical support with their Hyperwall Lecture Series. I was fortunate enough to even witness a rocket launch!

								</iframe></p>
								
								<p>I've gained a lot of experience in company operations, marketing, sales, logistics, event planning, product planning/launch/management, channel rep and integrator
									relations, and so much more. Now that I'm in a new country, I'm ready to step up to bat again to see what I can offer to a new company.
								</p>

								<p> While you're here, please do take a look at my <a href="https://tjkyong.netlify.app/tjkyong_cv_071721.pdf" target="blank">CV</a> and let me know if you are interested in learning more about me,
									and how I could be a fit for your company. I work great with teams and can take leadership roles, but I am also a go-getter type that works 
									perfectly fine alone as well.

							<h2 class="major">Work experience</h2>
							<p>I spent the last four years working for Z. It was a small company that offered Audio Visual solutions at the commercial level.
								The CEO had downsized the company a few years back to focus on another project, and hiring me was an attempt to revitalize Z. When
								I joined as the Director of Sales, they had a few loyal accounts, but it was struggling.	</p>
							<p>In my first month, I landed an account with a company that built booths for tradeshows. We were to offer a turnkey solution of renting out our
								video wall displays and providing installation and tech support. This really opened up the door to a new rental market, and this account led to 
							    many other accounts in the same booth building sector.</p>
							<p>I remember my second account very clearly, as it was a subsidiary of JP Morgan in the real estate market. They wanted an interactive WayFinding kiosk
								in each of their 6 lobbies that provided map guidance to users, as well as provide other information they wanted to convey. We provided six 40" 
								touchscreen displays connected to Intel NUCs. I created an Amazon EC2 instance of a Windows server so that all 6 computers can be updated remotely. 
								The hard part was creating the Wayfinding software. The next two months I spent with our engineer and designer to create maps of the buildings
								and creating routes, creating database of tenants, and so much more. But it was a huge sale, and even to this day an important account as they still
								pay monthly for server usage and support.	</p>
							
							<p>Up to this point our strategy was direct sales to businesses and consumers, but I decided to try to work into our strategy channel sales. I contracted
								manufacturer's reps from different territories and was able to snag with them their reseller/integrator contacts as well. This was a huge change 
								because now integrators called us
							</p>
							<p>I had pretty much become the spokesman of the company, dealing with all external requests, making contracts with distributors/integrators/reps,
								reaching out to vendors and managing key government accounts. I was also responsible for creating bids for government RFQs. 
							</p>
							<p>By the time I left Z, I was personally averaging $250,000 per quarter in sales, not to shabby for starting out by cold-calling with zero leads. 
								I'm sure if COVID hadn't struck, and I hadn't left sales would have kept climbing YoY, especially because our "channel" network was becoming
								well established and I had just completed Z's GSA contract which listed us onto government procurement databases as a trusted manufacturer.
							<p>Because of these experience at Z, my knowledge in company operations is very rounded. I believe that this gives me an edge and also the confidence
								to be able to take on a variety of roles, whatever they may be, at my next opportunity. I accept and await my newest challenge!
							</p>

						<!-- Demos -->
						<article id="demo">
							<h2 class="major">Demos</h2>
							<p> I have organized exhibitions at dozens of tradeshows including CES, Infocomm, DSE and more. While exhibiting,
								I liked to take the opportunity to film a video showcasing our newest products. The videos are short, and always
								taken in one take, so please excuse and brain-farts I may have had!

									we can learn and learn but there is always more to discover." 	</p>

								<p>July 18, 2021</p>
								<p> I had taken and completed 3 courses on codecademy using their 7 day trial in early June. However, their certificate expired because I never paid I guess.
									So I paid for a month of the Pro Version to relink those certificates and finish some courses that I never completed.</p>

								<p>Today I'm going to take a look at the course titled "Learn The Basics Of Blockchain With Python". I have a basic understanding of Python from 
									the course I had started a few months back on Udemy, but I'd say I'm only about 50% fluent. I also have an interest in cryptocurrency and how 
									the blockchain works so this seems like a fun course. Blockchain could potentially be a powerful tool in the future and knowing is half the battle.
									I am a fan of ADA Cardano, and they deployed in Africa as an identification system for their students. 
								</p>
								<p>I've gained some linux and BASH knowledge from the Google IT Support Specialist course and tidbits from here and there. But I'll work on Linux course
									here as well. I do like codecademy because it is a more hands-on approach than just reading a manual or watching a tutorial video.
								</p>
								<p>I'll also work on this website a little more:</p>
									<ul> 
										<li>add archives to this blog section</li>
										<li>add archives to this blog section</li>
										<li>add more about my experience at Zoom Digital</li>
										<li>maybe add a page with videos of my presentations/tutorials. Probably a link to a youtube playlist. maybe include
											the certs I've obtained
										</li>
										<li>maybe add a music page? link to my soundcloud, some photos? maybe not.</li>
									</ul>	
								<p>That's probably a butt-load for today.</p>

							<h2 class="major">What I'm learning.</h2>
								<p>July 17th, 2021</p>
								<p>I've been self-studying a lot of different topics in the last few months, mostly in the broad field of IT. It includes network systems, network security,
									cloud networks, linux os, python, web development, ethical hacking and more. I've been considering diving deeper into a specific field and getting
									a certification, but I haven't decided which path to go. Three options are:	</p>
									<ul>
										<li>CCNA</li>
										<li>Comptia Network Security+</li>
										<li>AWS Solutions Architect Associate</li>
									</ul>
								<p>One of these certs is what will consume most of my time. However I am always looking up random things. I just recently learned of Netlify, and how I 
									can host websites for free by linking with github. Like this website, and my landing page! They are two separate git repositories. I got a free .tk 
									domain and forwarded it to the landing page. So these two websites are 100% free as I have both the hosting and DNS taken care of.	</p>
								<p>Surprisingly, ordering from Amazon US only charges $8.75 for shipping to Korea. I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered a Raspberry Pi 4, 8GB with the Canakit
									which provides me with everything I need. It also takes less than 1 week to ship. I think it will arrive in the next few days so I will be tinkering with that!
									I have a bunch of micro SD cards ready to try different projects. </p>
								<p>I'm thinking of making this section into a blogging style area. I'll "archive" each post into a link here at first... or maybe title them. 
									I dunno! This site is a work in progress!</p>
